## Info

This is an accessibility tool, intended to help those who are hard of hearing or deaf, but it may also be useful for other people who simply prefer seeing subtitles. [Visit the wiki for more information, including installation instructions](https://github.com/gt0777/VRCLiveCaptionsMod/wiki).
